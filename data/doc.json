This is the first of 4 pieces devoted to exploring little-known scientific findings about science. Specifically, the unexpected or underappreciated aspects of how we do science, and its implications.","background":[{"type":"text","value":"But what happens when trust in science erodes? Psychology, my field of study for nearly a decade, is facing just such a <a href=”https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/psychologys-replication-crisis-real/576223/”>crisis</a>. <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc”>Power poses</a>? <a href=”https://slate.com/technology/2016/01/amy-cuddys-power-pose-research-is-the-latest-example-of-scientific-overreach.html”>Highly questionable</a>.

But things aren’t quite as simple. I’ll explain why."}],"part-1":[{"type":"text","value":"In 2013, a group of researchers led by UBC’s Timothy Vine found that the <a href=”https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(13)01400-0”>availability of research data declines rapidly with article age</a>*. Say you’re a researcher, and you want to conduct a replication of some analysis that people have been citing for years, because you’ve got a hunch that conclusions aren’t airtight; there’s a 90% likelihood that these data just <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbBD7VIJ4cc&feature=youtu.be&t=67”>aren’t around</a> anymore. But what does that really mean, in terms of concrete terms? How much of our work, as scientists, no longer has the data behind it?"}],"part-2":[{"type":"text","value":"The whole thesis relies on the literature review, where I scour the available evidence to set frame my hypothesis about the impact of our psyche on physiological symptoms. Using the probabilities in the paper we first discussed, I’ve color-coded each sentence that included a citation to past research. Dark passages are more likely to have data behind the studies; light ones are likely missing the raw data which led to the findings in the first place."},{"type":"text","value":"ZOOM INTO THE SECTION THAT COMPRISES THE TEXT"}],"part-4":[{"type":"text","value":"Here’s how much of the paper disappears if we remove the studies that almost certainly have no data behind them."},{"type":"text","value":"REMOVE 90+% LIKELIHOOD TEXT"}],"part-5":[{"type":"text","value":"Let’s drop everything that’s 70% likely to have absent data. The amount of findings that I relied on in this literature review that’s available for others to reassess is drastically reduced here."},{"type":"text","value":"REMOVE 70+% LIKELIHOOD TEXT"}],"methods-and-caveats":[{"type":"text","value":"*these findings pertain to biological data found in biology journals; the specific numbers may very well differ based on discipline."}]}
