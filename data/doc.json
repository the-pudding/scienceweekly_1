This is the first of 4 pieces devoted to exploring little-known scientific findings about science. Specifically, the unexpected or underappreciated aspects of how we do science, and its implications.","part-1":"Academic science consists of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants target=_blank>standing on the shoulders of giants</a>: we run experiments, submit the results to expert peers, and publish the summaries so that others can use them as foundations for their own research. As scientists, we tend to see these results as trustworthy, and base our careers — years of graduate school, postdoctoral training, and professorships — on the contents of published results. But what happens when trust in science erodes? Psychology, my field of study for nearly a decade, is facing precisely such a <a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/psychologys-replication-crisis-real/576223/>crisis</a>. The popular concept of <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc>power poses</a>? <a href=https://slate.com/technology/2016/01/amy-cuddys-power-pose-research-is-the-latest-example-of-scientific-overreach.html>Highly questionable</a>. Established findings such as <a href=https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html>implicit bias</a>? Thoroughly <a href=https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html>suspect</a>. So what can we do to foster other’s trust in our findings? One solution would be to give researchers access to the relevant raw data to analyze for themselves. Unfortunately, that’s easier said than done.","part-2":"In 2013, a group of researchers led by UBC’s Timothy Vine found that the <a href=https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(13)01400-0>availability of research data declines rapidly with article age</a>. Say you’re a young researcher, and you’ve got a hunch that some highly-lauded study published two decades ago actually hinges on nothing but poor analysis and someone’s dreams of tenure; Vine et al. found that there’s a 90% likelihood that these data simply <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbBD7VIJ4cc&feature=youtu.be&t=67>aren’t around</a> anymore. But what does that really mean, in concrete terms? How much of our work, as scientists, is the equivalent of an iceberg tip whose bottom melted away?","part-3":"When I was younger, I wanted to be an academic — I studied the link between our mental and physical states. Here’s a portion of my Master’s thesis, submitted in 2013, the same year as Vine’s paper on data availability. You’re seeing the literature review, the bedrock of my thesis. It’s a compilation of prior research, which all my work rests on. Based on the Vine’s findings, let’s see how likely I would be to obtain the original data used in these studies.","part-4":"Nearly every sentence in a literature review has a citation, or a reference to some older study that skeptical readers should consult for evidence regarding the claims I’m making. I’ve color-coded each one: darker passages are more likely to have data behind the studies; lighter ones are likely missing the raw data which led to the findings in the first place.","part-5":"Let’s remove the studies that have a high likelihood of having inaccessible data. The result? Most of what I’ve used as a foundation for two years of research disappears. Most of the data behind journal articles — in essence, short summaries of experiments — has, for all intents and purposes, vanished. So what’s the fix to restoring some faith in scientific discovery? Apart from heighetning researchers’ own awareness of data erosion, we should push for de facto submissions of raw, anonymized data (when ethically possible) to <a href=https://collections.plos.org/10yr-datasets>journals</a>.","part-6":"Findings in the  <a href=https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(13)01400-0>2013 paper on data availability</a> pertain to biological data found in biology journals; the specific numbers will likely differ by discipline. Additionally, the likelihoods of data availability should not be taken as an indicator that any specific study lacks sufficient data-storage protocols, bur rather, as a rough indicator of directional relationship between a citation’s age and its data’s availability. You may find the thesis cited in this project <a href=http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;current_base=GEN01&amp;object_id=117003>here</a>."}
