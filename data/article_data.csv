"By several estimates, lactose intolerance, LI, affects the majority of the world´s population (Andersson, Dotevall, Dahlqvist, & Walan, 1970; Itan, Jones, Ingram, Swallow, & Thomas, 2010)"
". In spite of this widespread prevalence, common notions of LI among both practitioners and the public tend to be simplistic. 
Many people lose their natural ability to metabolize lactose as they age, with this decline in metabolic capacity resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms after eating too much dairy. Clinical research, however, consistently shows a marked gap between lactose intake and subsequent symptom formation, regardless of LI diagnostic status. Lactase deficient individuals do not always experience symptoms after consuming lactose, while those with adequate lactase activity are not always symptom-free (Vesa, Korpela, & Sahi, 1996)"
". Apparently, lactase activity is not the only factor contributing to LI. Evidence from diverse experimental and clinical paradigms suggests that individual biology is but one determinant of physiological responses to lactose intake (Shaukat et al., 2010)"
". 
In the present paper we examine the relationship between diagnostic status, lactose ingestion and symptom development in clinical LI research. After outlining some of the difficulties involved in diagnosing LI, we review a number of studies that highlight notable inconsistencies between diagnosis and symptom formation. Building on recent advances in the study and treatment of pain and irritable bowel syndrome,IBS, we propose psychological factors, most notably expectancies, as the missing link underlying the documented variations in LI symptom presentation. 
Expectancies relating to dairy contribute not only to an individual’s lactose responses, both in the clinic and at home, but to their future food choices and dietary behaviours as well. While practitioners — doctors, dieticians and others — acknowledge a role for patient psychology in LI, many consider this role limited to people who continue to report problems with dairy despite a negative diagnosis. However, as we demonstrate below, psychology influences the responses of the severely intolerant as well. With greater appreciation for psychological influences in LI, practitioners will be better equipped to diagnose the condition and discuss management strategies with patients. Moreover, as a modifiable determinant of symptom development, expectancies offer a viable tool for managing symptoms and improving quality of life. 
The lactase enzyme cleaves lactose present in mammalian milk into monosaccharides for uptake from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream. This enzyme is abundant in newborns and, decreasing with age, persists into adulthood to varying degrees (Harrington & Mayberry, 2008)"
". Many individuals, however, do not produce adequate amounts of lactase to break down the lactose they consume. Known as lactase non-persistence — LNP, also referred to as hypolactasia — this condition results in lactose maldigestion, where colonic microflora ferment the undigested lactose, leading to the production of hydrogen and other metabolic by-products. These by-products, together with increased osmotic pressure and water retention, contribute gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, stomach rumbling, or flatulence. When maldigestion is paired with symptoms following a lactose challenge, a diagnosis of LI is deemed appropriate (Gasbarrini et al., 2009)"
". 
Research into the rates of LNP documents a wide variation in global and ethnic prevalence. Whereas in the United States the prevalence is 15% among Caucasians, 53% among Mexican-Americans, and 80% in Blacks, proportions reach almost 100% in certain Asian countries (Sahi, 1994; Scrimshaw & Murray, 1988)"
". It is crucial to remember, however, that prevalence estimates are for LNP, not LI. Research in Sicily, for example, demonstrates that, among a random sample of 323 from the general population, 32% were LNP but tolerant, whereas only 4% were LNP and intolerant (Carroccio, Montalto, Cavera, & Notarbatolo, 1998)"
". Regardless of prevalence, the diagnosis of LI is only as accurate as the supporting clinical tests practitioners typically employ. 
Clinicians frequently assess LNP using the hydrogen breath test — HBT— wherein they measure the amount of hydrogen in expired air following the consumption of a standardized lactose challenge. Other assays, such as blood glucose — also known as the lactose tolerance test, or LTT — stool acidity, or internal biopsy analyses are more invasive, and are therefore less common (Hermans, Brummer, Ruijgers, & Stockbrugger, 1997; Scrimshaw & Murray, 1988; Vesa, Marteau, & Korpela, 2000)"
". The most recent method involves genetic testing for single nucleotide polymorphisms correlated with a deficiency in the lactase enzyme (N. S. Enattah et al., 2002)"
", While genetic and phenotypic  — HBT and LTT — test results are highly correlated, with all offering similar diagnostic value in terms of hypolactasia, they do not provide a reliable link to symptoms and, therefore, LI (Di Stefano et al., 2009; Marton, Xue, & Szilagyi, 2012)"
". 
Many physicians are aware of the lack of direct relationship between LNP-based maldigestion and symptoms, and may diagnose LI based solely on patient interviews and self-reported symptoms. These methods are not wholly reliable due to their singular dependence on one-off subjective accounts, and the likelihood of falsely attributing symptoms to lactose consumption (Di Stefano et al., 2009; Suarez, Savaiano, Arbisi, & Levitt, 1997)"
". Whether lactase persistent or non-persistent, people who p exaggerate the severity of domestic symptoms relative to those reported in a clinical setting (Suarez et al., 1997)"
". Moreover, research on memory confirms that personal accounts are susceptible to leading questions, which arise naturally in the clinic as practitioners search for diagnostic clues (Vesa et al., 1996)"
". When a patient presents with recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms – a common occurrence – practitioners invariably inquire about dairy consumption. As a secondary tool, clinicians may recommend avoiding dairy and monitoring whether or not symptoms abate. This practice, however, can easily lead to false attribution and may contribute to the high number of individuals who self-report as LI but are actually lactase persistent (Carroccio et al., 1998; Johnson, Semenya, Buchowski, Enwonwu, & Scrimshaw, 1993; Suarez, Savaiano, & Levitt, 1995)"
". 
In sum, the battery of tests used to diagnose LNP lack of both validity and reliability as independent diagnostic tools for LI. The various markers of maldigestion consistently fail to correlate with the occurrence of physiological symptoms, and self-reported symptoms suffer from the vagaries of memory and misattribution. As a result, a wide gap emerges between the assessment of LI and the manifestation of its symptoms, forcing clinicians to rely on insufficient or unreliable information, and leaving patients vulnerable to false expectations. 
A persistent disparity between lactose maldigestion and symptoms has long marked the LI literature. Indeed, studies frequently note that individuals who claim intolerance can consume moderate amounts of lactose, despite being maldigesters. Alternatively, individuals with both deficient and persistent lactase activity often develop symptoms after consuming lactose-free foods.
Whereas high doses of lactose, such as those exceeding 50g, cause symptoms in the majority maldigesters when taken on an empty stomach, responses to low doses of lactose are generally unaffected by individual lactase levels (Beyerlein et al., 2008; Casellas, Varela, Aparici, Casaus, & Rodriguez, 2009)"
". Double-blind trials with people reporting severe LI demonstrate that most individuals can, in fact, tolerate one cup of milk — approximately 12g of lactose — with negligible symptoms (Suarez et al., 1995)"
". Follow-up research reveals that they could consume two cups of milk, one at breakfast, and one at dinner, with only minor symptoms proportional to those experienced by lactase persistent participants in the control group. In fact, self-described intolerants rated symptoms — for example,  abdominal pain, bloating, stomach rumbling — after consumption as trivial (Suarez et al., 1997)"
". A systematic review investigating the maximum dose of lactose tolerable to individuals with LI or maldigestion found similar results: most could tolerate 12-15g, and insufficient data were available to confirm the hypothesis that solutions with 0-2g of lactose led to less severe symptoms than those with 12g (Shaukat et al., 2010)"
". Such findings suggest that low doses of lactose, as well as larger doses coupled with meals or staggered in time, are sufficiently metabolized by self-proclaimed intolerant individuals to avoid symptoms. 
Another course of research, comprising of a randomized double-blind crossover study of previously diagnosed lactose maldigesters and digesters, showed no differences in symptoms between participants who consumed 7g of lactose and those who consumed none (Vesa et al., 1996)"
": all participants, in both diagnostic groups, demonstrated symptoms of lactose intolerance suggesting a lack of physiological differentiation between these amounts. These results suggest that even when symptoms do occur at low doses, below 7g, lactase activity does not contribute to their formation. Research by Suarez at al. points to an additional contributing factor (Suarez et al., 1995)"
": while gastrointestinal symptoms following milk consumption were minimal for participants regardless of their status as maldigesters or digesters, during the selection of maldigesters for the study, 30% of the participants were identified as lactose digesters who manifested symptoms with no known physiological cause. Observations of maldigesters and digesters developing symptoms to quantities of lactose that previous studies have deemed negligible, as well as findings of digesters manifesting symptoms with no physiological reason, suggest that lactose and lactase are not the only contributors to LI symptoms (Shaukat et al., 2010; Suarez et al., 1995)"
". 
Such inconsistencies between physiological lactase activity and symptom manifestation also emerge from research examining lactose maldigestion among African Americans. Recruiting participants who claimed to experience symptoms after consuming milk, one study measured the extent to which reported symptoms corresponded to lactose intake (Johnson et al., 1993)"
". After selecting a group of lactose maldigesters using the HBT, the experimenters offered participants lactose-containing or lactose-free milk in repeated trials. One third of all maldigesters manifested symptoms to both solutions, suggesting that lactose was not responsible for a third of these effects. Moreover, the study’s selection procedure revealed 15% of the participants to be lactose digesters who nonetheless exhibited symptoms with no clear physiological cause. Once again, these results indicate that a parameter other than lactose metabolism underlies the manifestation of LI symptoms, at least in some people and situations. 
Meta-analytic findings lend the strongest support to this conclusion (Savaiano, Boushey, & McCabe, 2006)"
". Researchers examined 21 studies contrasting maldigesters’ responses to placebo or to quantities of lactose typically found in meals — up to 12g — and found that lactose itself was not a major cause of symptoms. Moreover, when researchers assessed 353 patients referred for an HBT, they found that participants would retrospectively rate their reaction to lactose consumption at home as much more severe than their reaction to their consumption of lactose in the laboratory, as part of the HBT (Casellas, Aparici, Casaus, Rodríguez, & Malagelada, 2010)"
". Curiously, patients’ home meals were likely to contain much less lactose — only 25% — than the 50g used in the HBT. Numerous teams have suggested that psychology, in addition to biology, may contribute to such disparate results (Shaukat et al., 2010; Suarez et al., 1997)"
" 
 LI research has tended to refrain from examining the role of mental factors in symptom development, particularly at the experimental level. Nevertheless, psychological mechanisms contribute meaningfully to self-perceptions and clinical diagnoses of LI. 
Certain personality traits may predispose individuals to experience subjective bodily complaints with no visible organic cause. In a recent study of 109 individuals referred to a gastroenterology unit, researchers found a greater proportion of LI — 29% —than maldigestion — 18% — in the sample, in response to a low-dose, 15g HBT (Tomba, Baldassarri, Coletta, Cesana, & Basilisco, 2012)"
". LI and maldigestion were not associated, and symptoms were less severe in patients with maldigestion. Although results suggested that patients’ tendencies towards the mental trait of somatization—the reporting of subjective somatic complaints with no evident organic causes—were associated with LI symptoms, previous research found no pathological somatization scores in severe LI sufferers (Suarez et al., 1997)"
". 
Additionally, classical conditioning may lead to robust gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who previously experienced unrelated symptoms after eating dairy (Bernstein, 1999)"
". Alternatively, at the conscious level, misattribution can mislead people to retrospectively ascribe unrelated gastrointestinal symptoms to dairy (Schacter, 1999)"
". Consistent diagnostic anomalies comprising of lactose absorbers who develop symptoms and maldigesters who do not, however, may also result from a broader and more pervasive mechanism, fed by both conditioning and misattribution: expectancies. 
Rotter, first to systematically theorize on expectancies, defined them as the beliefs that certain stimuli predict other stimuli (Rotter, 1954)"
". Rotter postulated that the likelihood of performing a behaviour depends, in part, on the value of its reinforcer, and the expectancy that the behaviour will bring about the desired outcome. While Rotter applied this strictly to voluntary behaviour, such as exercising to reap the benefits of good health, Kirsch expanded the concept of expectancies to include involuntary responses (1985, 1997a)"
". Specifically, Kirsch hypothesized that non-voluntary reactions such as emotions, sexual arousal, or pain, also have reinforcement value, and that one’s expectancies relating to their occurrence as a result of particular behaviour strongly affect whether or not that behaviour will be performed. 
Positive response expectancies may lead to numerous psychological changes ranging from sexual arousal, increased alertness and drowsiness to relief from anxiety and other conditions (Ross & Buckalew, 1983)"
". These states are not simply subjective, however – they can lead to objective physiological responses, including variations in blood pressure, heart rate, and gastric function (Ross & Buckalew, 1983)"
". Although such changes are difficult to explain at the molecular level, researchers posit that physiological changes stem from mental changes, since psychological states naturally have corresponding physical states (Kirsch, 1985)"
". 
Negative expectancies can likewise lead to adverse effects (Hahn, 1997)"
". A study with students expecting to experience headaches in response to the administration of an electrical current offers strong support. Although the experimenters never engaged the current, 70% of students reported headaches in response to the sham procedure. Remarkably, these headaches persisted even after the students learned that the current was never applied (Schweiger & Parducci, 1981)"
". In addition to internal sources of pain, negative expectancies can also affect exterior physiology; 11 of 13 participants sensitive to a particular noxious plant showed no noticeable skin reaction when exposed to the plant while believing it was harmless (Ikemi, 1962)"
". Conversely, 12 of the same 13 participants exhibited signs of dermatitis when exposed to an innocuous plant believed to be poisonous. 
Chronic conditions, such as food allergies, may also be subject to the effects of expectancies, as demonstrated in a double-blinded study of individuals receiving injections of either allergen or saline (Jewett, Fein, & Greenberg, 1990)"
". Both groups manifested the typical allergic reactions — for example, eye irritation and nausea — in comparable proportions. The most notable finding, however, came when participants received neutralizing injections to alleviate their allergic reactions. The active anti-allergen was no more effective at neutralizing the symptoms than the placebo control – the same saline injection used in the previous condition. In addition to eliciting allergic reactions, negative expectancies can trigger symptoms of asthma, refraction epilepsy, anticipatory nausea, as well as side effects listed on a consent form (Hahn, 1999)"
". 
The importance of expectancies in pain is well documented. As demonstrated in a formative study by Baker and Kirsch, expectancies of pain sensation directly influence perceptions of pain. When asked to rate the perceived pain of a task that involved immersing their hands in cold water, participants who learned a cognitive coping strategy to temper expectancies reported lower pain scores than participants who did not learn to cope (Baker & Kirsch, 1991)"
". Numerous groups have confirmed this conclusion using both similar and discrepant experimental paradigms, firmly establishing a role for expectancies in pain (Price, Hirsh, & Robinson, 2008; Sullivan, Rodgers, & Kirsch, 2001; Vervoort, Goubert, Eccleston, Bijttebier, & Crombez, 2006)"
". 
Research on IBS – a chronic intestinal condition characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation – suggests that expectancies also contribute to gastrointestinal symptom formation and relief. Meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials for IBS reveal strong response rates among patients treated with inert substances, suggesting that the condition is responsive to placebo effects and other psychological or contextual cues (Ford & Moayyedi, 2010; Patel et al., 2005)"
". While placebo effects seem to operate through multiple mechanisms, expectancies are an essential component (Stewart-Williams & Podd, 2004)"
". In a study demonstrating the nuanced impact of positive expectancies on symptom relief in IBS, patients were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: waitlist, sham acupuncture, or sham acupuncture coupled with a positive doctor-patient relationship. Despite the absence of any physiologically-based intervention, the proportion of patients reporting adequate relief was 28%, 44%, and 62%, respectively (Kaptchuk et al., 2008)"
". 
A recent randomized controlled trial for IBS treatment using open-label placebos offers additional support for expectancies as a determinant of symptom relief. To create positive expectancies in a non-deceptive manner, the researchers told participants that “placebo pills made of an inert substance, like sugar pills… have been shown in clinical studies to produce significant improvement in IBS symptoms through mind-body self-healing processes,” prior to randomization (Kaptchuk et al., 2010)"
". Compared to patients in the no treatment arm, placebo- treated individuals reported lower symptom severity and higher scores for global improvement and adequate relief. 
In light of the high comorbidity between IBS and LI, in addition to their shared symptoms and considerable clinical overlap (Vernia, Marinaro, Argnani, Di Camillo, & Caprilli, 2004; Vesa, Seppo, Marteau, Sahi, & Korpela, 1998)"
", we posit that expectancies similarly mediate symptoms of LI. 
A recent study provides intriguing insight into the potential impact of expectancies on symptoms of LI. Experimenters examined 27 participants who had previously exhibited false negatives on the HBT — that is to say, showed no increased hydrogen production, but manifested symptoms in response to the 50g of lactose they consumed (Vernia, Di Camillo, Foglietta, Avallone, & De Carolis, 2010)"
". These participants underwent a sham HBT, receiving 1g of lactose instead of the standard dose, wherein any reaction would stem purely from psychological sources; in response, 12 exhibited symptoms. Of the 54 controls with documented LI, however, 14 also manifested symptoms. Since these findings emerged as part of a larger course of research lacking a randomised control design, we cannot ascertain that these effects arose from expectancies rather than from conditioned responses. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates the notable degree of psychological influence on symptoms. 
In addition, the expectancy framework may clarify previously puzzling study results, such as lactose digesters developing symptoms during an HBT, and both maldigesters and digesters developing symptoms to solutions with negligible amounts of lactose (Johnson et al., 1993; Suarez et al., 1995; Vesa et al., 1996)"
". Individuals strongly believing themselves to be intolerant may have robust expectancies of experiencing symptoms during LI assessment—after all, patients see this as a litmus test identifying those with LI. If their symptoms should ever manifest, patients should expect them to do so at this juncture. 
Despite the dearth of rigorous experimental research assessing the role of psychological factors in responses to lactose, expectancies appear to bridge the gap between a diagnosis of LNP – or even LI – and symptoms resulting from lactose ingestion. In addition to elucidating self-reported maldigesters’ capacities to tolerate low doses of lactose, and lactase-persistent individuals’ manifestation of symptoms, factors such as expectancies, as well as conditioning and personality traits, may help obviate existing confusion about lactose intolerance testing. Physicians frequently attribute non-specific self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms to lactose intolerance, thereby inadvertently imparting similar beliefs on their patients, irrespective of their actual condition. Indeed, research has demonstrated that physicians’ attitudes and verbal cues can engender negative expectancies and patients’ subsequent clinical deterioration (Benedetti, Lanotte, Lopiano, & Colloca, 2007)"
". The laboratory environment wherein doctors conduct diagnostic assessments of lactose intolerance may further reinforce this belief. Self-professed LI individuals’ subsequent abstinence from lactose, coupled with expectations of symptoms following lactose consumption, may condition them to react negatively to the ingestion of any product which they believe contains lactose, further cementing their convictions of LI. 
In addition to the negative feedback they provide, such negative expectancies not only impact one’s quality of life but also pose a concrete health risk. Despite numerous studies documenting that the majority of LI individuals may consume a moderate amount of lactose and remain asymptomatic (Suarez et al., 1997)"
", many choose to exclude all dairy products from their diets upon diagnosis irrespective of their actual lactose content . In North America, where dairy is the primary source of calcium but also an important source of other vitamins and minerals, this type of diet may prove dangerous (Fleming & Heimbach, 1994; Matlik et al., 2007)"
". If such individuals fail to consume alternative sources of calcium, their needless excision of dairy will contribute to the development of osteoporosis (Buchowski, Semenya, & Johnson, 2002)"
". And accurate diagnosis of LI is essential to prevent the pernicious development of conditions such as osteoporosis. 
In order to control for both patient expectancies and physicians’ cues, the ideal diagnosis would involve repeated, double-blind administration of the HBT. Unfortunately, such diagnoses are costly and time-consuming for practitioners and patients alike. Physician and patient education on the potential effects of expectancies, as well as other factors involved in LI, are, therefore, paramount to improving symptom management and dietary planning. 
Of course, psychological factors do not wholly explain the discrepancies evident in LI research, with personal eating habits, intestinal microflora, and digestion time contributing to variation in symptoms as well (Szilagyi et al., 2005; Vesa et al., 2000)"
". Nevertheless, LI research frequently mentions, albeit in passing, that psychological factors play a role in symptom manifestation, and our review suggests that they constitute a plausible contributor to LI (Shaukat et al., 2010; Suarez et al., 1995; Vernia et al., 2010)"
